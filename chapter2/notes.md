Variables and Datatype
A variable is the name given to a memory location in a program. For example.
a = 30

# variables = container to store a value
b = "anything..." # keywords = reserved words in python
c = 71.22   # identifiers = class/function/variable name

Data Types
Primarily these are the following data types in Python:
1. Integers
2. Floating point numbers
3. Strings
4. Booleans
5. None

Python is a fantastic language that automatically identifies the type of data for us.
a = 71         
b = 88.44      
# identifies a as class <int>
# identifies b as class <float>
name = "anything..." # identifies name as class <str>

Rules for Choosing an Identifier
A variable name can contain alphabets, digits, and underscores.
A variable name can only start with an alphabet and underscores.
A variable name canʼt start with a digit.
No white space is allowed to be used inside a variable name.
Examples of a few variable names are: anything..., one8, seven_, _seven etc.

Operators in Python
Following are some common operators in python:
1. Arithmetic operators: +, -, *, / etc.
2. Assignment operators: =, +=, -= etc.
3. Comparison operators: ==, >, >=, <, != etc.
4. Logical operators: and, or, not.

type() Function and Typecasting:

type() function is used to find the data type of a given variable in python.
a = 31
type(a) # class <int>
b = "31"
type(b) # class <str>

A number can be converted into a string and vice versa (if possible)
There are many functions to convert one data type into another.
str(31)    

# integer to string conversion
int("32")  # string to integer conversion
float(32)  # integer to float conversion
... and so on.
Here "31" is a string literal and 31 a numeric literal.

Input() Function
This function allows the user to take input from the keyboard as a string.

a = input("enter name") # if a is "anything...", the user entered anything...

It is important to note that the output of input is always a string (even if a number is entered)
